## Introduction
This project provides a detailed analysis of COVID-19 trends and vaccination progress in India. Using reliable datasets and analytical tools, we explore key metrics such as case trends, vaccination rates, and their correlation with pandemic management efforts.

**The aim of this analysis** is to present actionable insights through data visualization and statistical methods, helping to better understand the impact of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of India's vaccination campaign.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used :
- Language : Python
- Library : Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- IDE : Google colab

üóÇÔ∏è Dataset : [Dataset]()

## Import required libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
from datetime import datetime
```
- **Libraries and Tools Used üìö**
  
  - ```pandas```: For data manipulation and analysis, including reading, cleaning, and transforming datasets.
  - ```numpy```: For numerical computations and handling large datasets efficiently.
  - ```seaborn```: For creating advanced statistical visualizations with ease.
  - ```matplotlib.pyplot```: For basic plotting and visualizing data trends.
  - ```plotly.express```: For interactive and dynamic visualizations, enabling detailed exploration of the data.
  - ```plotly.subplots```: To create complex multi-plot visualizations for comparative analyses.
  - ```datetime```: For handling and processing date and time data, essential for time-series analysis.

## Explored the dataset
**1. Import the dataset**
```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```
- ```files.upload()```: This method allows us to upload files (e.g., CSV or Excel datasets) from their local machine directly into the Colab notebook.
                        Once uploaded, the dataset can be accessed and processed within the Colab runtime for further analysis.

**2. Load the dataset**
```python
covid19 = pd.read_csv('covid_19_india.csv')
print(covid19)
```
- ```pd.read_csv()```: This function reads the dataset (covid_19_india.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame, which is a tabular data structure used for analysis.

**3. Explore the dataset**
```python
#Display the columns name along with datatypes
covid19.columns

#Display the first 5 rows
covid19.head()

#Display the columns name, not-null count and data types of all column
covid19.info()

#Display the statistics calculation according to our dataset like count, mean, standard devaition, min, max etc.
covid19.describe()

```

**Repeat the all above steps for vaccination dataset**

## Dataset cleaning

**1. Drop the unwanted columns**
```python
covid19.drop(["Sno", "Time", "ConfirmedIndianNational", "ConfirmedForeignNational"], inplace = True, axis = 1)
```
- ```drop()```: This function is used to remove one or more columns (or rows) from the DataFrame.
- ```inplace=True```: Modifies the original DataFrame directly, instead of returning a new DataFrame.
- ```axis=1```: Specifies that we are dropping columns (not rows).

**2. Change the date format**
```python
covid19['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(covid19['Date'], format = '%Y-%m-%d')
```
- ```pd.to_datetime()```: This function converts the 'Date' column (which may be stored as text or an object) into a proper datetime object for easier manipulation and analysis.
- ```format='%Y-%m-%d'```: Specifies the format of the date in the dataset. Here, %Y-%m-%d indicates that the date follows the format Year-Month-Day (e.g., 2020-03-25).
  
- **Purpose:** By converting the 'Date' column to a datetime object, we can efficiently perform time-based operations, such as sorting, filtering, and aggregating data by date.

## Dataset analysis
**1. Calculate active cases**
```python
covid19['Active_cases'] = covid19['Confirmed']- (covid19['Cured'] + covid19['Deaths'])
covid19
```
- ```Confirmed```: Total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- ```Cured```: Total number of recovered patients.
- ```Deaths```: Total number of deceased patients.
- ```Active_cases```: The number of active cases is calculated by subtracting the sum of Cured and Deaths from Confirmed.

- **Output : This new column, 'Active_cases', represents the current number of individuals actively battling COVID-19 in the population.**

**2. Pivot Table Calculation**
```python
statewise = pd.pivot_table(covid19, values = ["Confirmed", "Deaths", "Cured"], index = "State/UnionTerritory", aggfunc = max) 
```
- ```pd.pivot_table()```: This function creates a pivot table, a summary table that aggregates data by specified indices (in this case, by state/territory).
- ```values=["Confirmed", "Deaths", "Cured"]```: Specifies the columns for which we want to compute the aggregated values (confirmed cases, deaths, and cured cases).
- ```index="State/UnionTerritory"```: Defines the rows of the pivot table by grouping the data by the "State/UnionTerritory" column.
- ```aggfunc=max```: Aggregates the data by calculating the maximum value for each state in the selected columns (e.g., the highest number of confirmed cases, deaths, and cures). This helps to get the most up-to-date or peak values.

- **Output : statewise DataFrame gives a clear, concise view of the maximum COVID-19 statistics for each state and union territory.**

```python
#calculate_recovery_rate
statewise["Recovery_rate"] = statewise["Cured"]*100/statewise["Confirmed"]

#calculate_mortality_rate
statewise["Mortality_rate"] = statewise["Deaths"]*100/statewise["Confirmed"]

#sort_the_values
statewise = statewise.sort_values(by = "Confirmed", ascending = False)

#visualize_pivot_table
statewise.style.background_gradient(cmap = "cubehelix")
```
- ```sort_values()```: This function sorts the DataFrame based on the specified column(s).
- ```by="Confirmed"```: Specifies that the sorting should be done based on the "Confirmed" column (i.e., total confirmed COVID-19 cases).
- ```ascending=False```: Orders the data in descending order (from highest to lowest). This helps to prioritize and display the states/territories with the highest number of confirmed cases at the top of the table.
- ```style.background_gradient()```: This function applies a color gradient to the background of the DataFrame based on the numerical values in each column.
- ```cmap="cubehelix"```: Specifies the colormap to use for the gradient. "cubehelix" is a perceptually uniform color map that ranges from dark to light tones, helping to highlight differences in data effectively.

## Extracting Insights from the dataset through visualization
